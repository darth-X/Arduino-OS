# Arduino-OS
This is a modular embedded runtime for Arduino like microcontrollers with dynamic display handeling, which I am making in my free time. I am here using an EEPROM (AT24C16N) which has a million write cycles and a lot of space according to the <a href="https://cdn-reichelt.de/documents/datenblatt/A300/24C08_16.PDF">data sheet</a>, rotatry encoder module, an I2C LCD communication driver and a LCD to make all of this work, which will be a stand alone system.

# Requirements
Here is a list of items you need would for this:<br><br>

Arduino UNO/MEGA/NANO/PI-PICO (Still need to check compability and use the pins which will be universally available)<br>
- EEPROM -> AT24C16N
- jumper wires
- rotatry encoder module
- I2C LCD driver
- LCD (16x2)
- Breadboard (or you could make your own custom PCB)

# Origin of this OS ~~thing?~~
This project is supposed to be a playground for myself. By this, I teach myself different concepts and learn in general.
